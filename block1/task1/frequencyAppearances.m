function [freqAppearanceClass, numCounts] = frequencyAppearances(groundTruth_dir, numClasses)
% COUNTCLASSAPPEARANCES Count the number of items in each class (e.g.:
% signal type)
%   Iterate over the Ground Truth (gt) text files to obtain the class
%   label and count the number of examples for each class. Once we have
%   the total number of items per class, we can compute the frequency of
%   appearance as: n_occurencesClass#/n_total_items.
%
%   Input parameters:
%       - groundTruth_dir:          directory where the gt txt files are
%                               stored. By default: '../Datasets/train_2017/train/gt'
%       - numClasses:               number of classes. E.g.: in the signals
%                                   example, numClasses=6 (signals from A-F).
%
%   Output parameters:
%       - freqAppearanceClass:   frequency of appearance of all clases
%                                   stored in a vector (for easier generali-
%                                   zation and operation).
%       - totalAppearances:      outputted to compute nÂº of counts per
%                                   class (if needed)
