# Code developed to perform week 2 tasks

## Instructions to run the code
**Run the script main.m in order to execute this code.**
The script calls all the necessary functions that perform the tasks sequentially.

From the split in week1/task2, we have:
* The train image that should be located at: *'/datasets/trafficsigns/train/'*
* The validation set should be placed on the same folder: *'/datasets/trafficsigns/validation'*
Both paths are relative to the folder where you have cloned this repo.
