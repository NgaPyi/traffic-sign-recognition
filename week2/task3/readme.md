# Code developed to filter mask generated with color segmentation

## 3 different methods have been implemented:

* **Method 1**: *'method1.m'*
* **Method 2**: *'morphFilterMask.m'*, run *'morphFilterMask_test.m'* to analyze performance on train or validation split.
* **Method 3**: *'morphFilterMask_v2.m'*, run *'morphFilterMask_test_v2.m'* to analyze performance on train or validation split.

The following auxiliar functions have been created:
* *'generateTestMasks.m'* saves test mask images.
* *'granulometry.m'* computes an image granulometry.
