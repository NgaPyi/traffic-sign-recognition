# Traffic Sign Detector

This project contains a *Matlab* implementation of classical computer vision techniques to detect traffic signs from photographs taken from cars while driving.

It was done during the **Introduction to Human and Computer Vision** module inside the **Master in Computer Vision Barcelona**.

The approach could be summarized as the following:

- Simple colour-based segmentation + Watershed segmentation
- Morphological filtering
- Geometrical filtering
- Template matching
